# CKD Multi-Stage Classification

This repository contains the full implementation of my MSc Data Science final project:

**Title**: *Multi-Stage Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Interpretable Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study*

---

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate predictive models that classify Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) into multiple stages based on clinical and demographic features. The pipeline includes traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting) and a deep neural network, along with interpretability techniques using SHAP.
